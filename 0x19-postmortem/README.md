**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: January 15, 2024, 09:45 AM (UTC)
  - End Time: January 15, 2024, 12:30 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:**
  - Unavailability of the user authentication service
  - 30% of users experienced login failures and delayed access
- **Root Cause:**
  - Database connection pool exhaustion due to a misconfigured connection limit

**Timeline:**
- **Detection:**
  - January 15, 2024, 09:45 AM (UTC)
  - Automated monitoring alerted the team about increased response times for user authentication.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - 09:50 AM: Investigated application logs for anomalies.
  - 10:05 AM: Assumed potential issues with the authentication service code and started code review.
  - 10:30 AM: Discovered a spike in database connection errors and shifted focus to database-related investigations.
- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Initial focus on application code slowed down the identification of the actual root cause.
  - An assumption of a DDoS attack led to unnecessary time spent on network-related investigations.
- **Escalation:**
  - 11:00 AM: Incident escalated to the Database Operations team as database-related issues were suspected.
- **Resolution:**
  - 12:30 PM: Identified misconfigured connection limits in the database pool settings.
  - 01:00 PM: Adjusted connection pool configurations to accommodate the application's demand.
  - 01:15 PM: Implemented rolling restarts to apply the configuration changes across the server fleet.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:**
  - Misconfigured connection limits in the database connection pool settings.
  - The application's increased traffic exceeded the defined pool capacity, leading to connection timeouts and failures.
- **Resolution:**
  - Adjusted the connection pool settings to increase the maximum allowed connections.
  - Conducted rolling restarts to apply the configuration changes without service downtime.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated alerting for database connection pool metrics to detect and respond to potential issues proactively.
  - Conduct regular capacity planning reviews to ensure systems can handle anticipated increases in traffic.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Short-Term:**
    - Patch the monitoring system to include database connection pool metrics.
    - Schedule regular code reviews to catch misconfigurations or scalability issues.
  - **Medium-Term:**
    - Enhance load testing procedures to simulate traffic spikes and assess system behavior.
    - Conduct a comprehensive review of application and database configurations to identify and address potential bottlenecks.
  - **Long-Term:**
    - Implement automated scaling for critical components to handle unforeseen increases in traffic.
    - Establish a knowledge-sharing session to educate the team on recognizing and responding to database-related issues.

**Conclusion:**
The outage was a result of misconfigured database connection pool settings. The incident highlighted the importance of comprehensive monitoring, timely escalation, and a systematic approach to root cause analysis. By implementing the outlined corrective and preventative measures, we aim to enhance the resilience of our web stack and better prepare for future challenges.

This postmortem serves as a learning opportunity for the team, emphasizing the need for continuous improvement and proactive measures to ensure the reliability and availability of our services.
